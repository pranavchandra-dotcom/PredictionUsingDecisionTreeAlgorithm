# PredictionUsingDecisionTreeAlgorithm
In this project, I developed a classifier to predict the class of new data using the Iris dataset, which contains 150 samples of Iris flowers from three different species. I conducted data preprocessing steps, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables, to ensure a clean dataset for model training. I implemented a Decision Tree classifier using scikit-learn, splitting the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance. The model was assessed using metrics such as accuracy score and confusion matrix, achieving accurate predictions. This project highlights my skills in machine learning, data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and data visualization, showcasing the ability to execute end-to-end data science projects efficiently.
